# GG2-Project-2-Extract-Transform-Load
## Project Proposal

Our primary motivation for this project is to find data sets for the trends that we have seen over the past several years with electric motor vehicle purchases. This was of interest to us as there is more awareness on decreasing the global carbon footprint and ever increasing gas prices. This seems to be causing more automobile companies to shift their focus and replace their flagship model sedans with electric versions and compete with companies like Tesla.

## Finding Data

Data sources used: We recommend the following sites to use as sources of data:

* CSVâ€™s:
    https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data
    https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-size-history
* API:
	https://rapidapi.com/luhar2992@gmail.com/api/electric-vehicle-updates/




## Project Report

A Final Report has been submitted that describes the following:

* **E**xtract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc).

* **T**ransform: what data cleaning or transformation was required.

* **L**oad: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.
